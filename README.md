# DQN-vrep
Simple scripts concern about continuous actions of DQN agent for VREP simluating domain.

Scripts implemented based on:

- Timothy P. Lillicrap *et al.*, "[Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971v4.pdf)"

DQN code-base originated from [DQN-chainer](https://github.com/ugo-nama-kun/DQN-chainer)
